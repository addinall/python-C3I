# mr-C3I COMMAND and CONTROL

This is one of several concurrent projects I am working on as part of my 2016 R&D.
Implementing the same application using a number of technology stacks.

- Modern, but still AJAX (AJaJ) RESTful client server systems
- Full stack Javascript systems using Angular
- Full stack Javascript systems using REact
- Full stack Javascript systems using custom components
- Python/Django - Bootstrap

This is my play on using the latest technologies to provide a flexible, robust and pleasing
UI(X), APIs and RESTFul transaction servers.

## Synopsis

This is an experimental system comprising 
- Asset management, 
- reporting, 
- tracking, 
- machine learning and 
- statistical process control over a distributed network.


I am writing this system using different technology elsewhere, but decided to
write this version concurrently 
N/Django and BOOTSTRAP.

It seemed a shame to leave PYTHON out of the mix.  The rechnology stack is a little
older than the full stack JS Frameworks; but if it works well, why not.
